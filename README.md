# Real-time Face Recognition-based Attendance Marking System

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time attendance system using face recognition technology. It captures live video feed from a webcam to detect and recognize faces by matching them against a pre-stored database. Recognized individuals have their attendance automatically marked with timestamps.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition using a webcam feed.
- Automated attendance marking for identified individuals.
- Daily attendance logs generated as CSV files named by the current date for easy tracking.

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV

## Usage
1. Set up the face database with images of individuals.
2. Run the system to start capturing webcam feed.
3. Attendance will be automatically recorded for recognized faces with timestamp logs saved daily.
